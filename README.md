## Design Challenge

This repository contains my execution of a design challenge task. I was provided with a finished website design (including images and assets, which are included in the repo) and tasked with replicating it as closely as possible. 

I chose to implement the project using **HTML/ JS** and **CSS** with **BEM** (Block Element Modifier) classes to familiarize myself with best practices.
